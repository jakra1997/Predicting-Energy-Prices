# ‚ö° Energy Price Forecasting with Multimodal AI

This project aims to forecast hourly energy prices using machine learning models that combine **structured time series data** (such as solar/wind/load/gas/oil) with **unstructured sentiment signals** extracted from energy-related news. </br>

## üìä Problem Overview

Accurate energy price forecasting is vital for traders, operators, and policy makers to manage risk, plan energy usage, and enable smart grids. Prices are affected by multiple factors, including:
- Renewable energy production
- Load (demand)
- Fuel prices (Oil, Gas)
- Weather conditions
- Public sentiment and geopolitical news

### Structured Data:
- Germany electricity grid data (2015‚Äì2020)
- Hourly resolution
- Features: solar, wind, load, temperature, gas/oil prices, irradiance

### Unstructured Data:
- ~100k filtered energy-related news headlines (2015‚Äì2019)
- Sentiment scored using BERT (avg score, positive ratio)
- Categorized and filtered by impactful topics (e.g., *Middle East*, *Markets*, *Politics*)

## üß™ Modeling Approaches

### Unimodal Approach:
- Model: `XGBoostRegressor`
- Features: Time lags, calendar signals, ratios (wind/load)
- Training on raw price data

### Multimodal Approach:
- Early-stage fusion of structured data + sentiment features
- Sentiment features lagged to avoid data leakage
- Slight improvement in RMSE observed across forecasting horizons

## ü§ñ Model Architecture

We explored:
- **Time-lagged feature engineering**
- **Smoothed rolling averages**
- **Derivative-based forecasting**
- **Sentiment-category interactions**
- **Total energy cost estimation:**
  - `Cost = Predicted Price √ó Load`

## üöÄ Deployment

### User Interface
To access the user interface, write: </br>
python -m streamlit run app.py </br> 


### üê≥ Docker + FastAPI (does not work)

Run a RESTful API to serve predictions:

#### Dockerfile Highlights:
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["uvicorn", "main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "8000"]
